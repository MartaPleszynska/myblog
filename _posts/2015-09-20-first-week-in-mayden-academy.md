The first week flew by. It was great to meet everyone and have a glimpse of how life in Mayden looks like.

Apart from the usual admin stuff, during these five days we have managed to learn about Scrum software development methodology where a team works as an unit to reach a common goal. We have set up development environment by installing a bunch o softwares like Homebrew, phpStrom, NPM, Sublime, Atom ( not sure if remebered them all).
