The first week has flown by. It was great to meet everyone and have a glimpse of how life at [Mayden](http://www.mayden.co.uk/) looks like.

Apart from the usual admin stuff, during these five days we have managed to learn about Scrum software development methodology where a team works as an unit to reach a common goal.

We have set up development environment by installing a bunch of programs like [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) - the missing package manager that allows to install, remove and update applicationa and packages;
[phpStrom](https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/) - smart code editor provides excellent support for PHP, HTML, JavaScript, CSS, Sass, Less, CoffeeScript, and many other languages;
[Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) - a sophisticated text editor for code, markup and prose;
[Atom](https://atom.io/) - another modern text editor;
[sequelPro ](http://www.sequelpro.com/) - a fast, easy-to-use Mac database management application for working with MySQL databases.

We have done some fun tutorials on Vim - another text editor (links available on [resources](/resources.md) page).

We have been introduced to [GitHub](https://github.com/) which is web-based Git repository hosting service. Git is a version control systems which helps to manage changes in documents, programs, files etc.

We were working with the Command Line and setting up our bash profile.

We have learned about LAMP (Linux Apache MySQL PHP) and set it up on our machines.

At last we learned how to use [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to create a site for our blog through [Treehouse](https://teamtreehouse.com/home) tutorials and this blog is the outcome.

Maybe it sounds a lot and I have probably forgotten mention some of the things we have done but is was exciting and I am looking forward to next week.
