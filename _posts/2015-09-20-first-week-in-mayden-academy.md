The first week flew by. It was great to meet everyone and have a glimpse of how life in Mayden looks like.

Apart from the usual admin stuff, during these five days we have managed to learn about Scrum software development methodology where a team works as an unit to reach a common goal.

We have set up development environment by installing a bunch o softwares like Homebrew, phpStrom, NPM, SublimeText, Atom, Vim, Dash ( not sure if remembered them all).

We have done some fun tutorials on Vim and watched some videos about other text editors (Atom, SublimeText, phpStorm)

We have been introduced to GitHub which is web-based Git repository hosting service. Git is a version control systems which helps to manage changes in documents, programs, files etc.

We were working with the command line amd setting up our bash profile.

We have learned about LAMP (Linux Apache MySQL PHP) and set it up on our machines.

At least we learned how to use Jekyll to create a site for our blog.
