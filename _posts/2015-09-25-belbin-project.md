So a few days ago we have been left with an idea to create a site on which you could complete [Belbin](http://www.belbin.com/) personality test... Six trainees, with little or no development experience, building dynamic website that will include forms, store data and calculate results, what could be the outcome?

After three days working together coding, testing, fixing we managed to pull it off on "Belbin 1.0" was born.

Home php site with will allow you to register and and create an unique id number against which your answer will be register and stored.

We have added some validation that will disallow to leave empty spaces or usage of invalid characters like: ?%&! etc. After successful registration you will see an instruction page and you can click and start a test.

There is one page per question. Each page has a form that consist of sentences and empty box to put value against it. There is validation on client and sever side to make sure that data entered is in correct format and saved successfully in database.

After completing all section you can view your results that includes the breakdown by team roles and some fancy graphs.

I think we have done pretty well.

I was positively surprised how well we worked as team. Each of us worked on a piece of code building the website and help each other along. We had a common goal and we worked together to achieve it.

I a looking forward to more project and more team work.
