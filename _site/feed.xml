        <title>First week in Mayden Academy</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The first week has flown by. It was great to meet everyone and have a glimpse of how life at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mayden.co.uk/&quot;&gt;Mayden&lt;/a&gt; looks like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from the usual admin stuff, during these five days we have managed to learn about Scrum software development methodology where a team works as an unit to reach a common goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have set up development environment by installing a bunch of programs like &lt;a href=&quot;http://brew.sh/&quot;&gt;Homebrew&lt;/a&gt; - the missing package manager that allows to install, remove and update applicationa and packages;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/&quot;&gt;phpStrom&lt;/a&gt; - smart code editor provides excellent support for PHP, HTML, JavaScript, CSS, Sass, Less, CoffeeScript, and many other languages;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sublimetext.com/&quot;&gt;Sublime Text&lt;/a&gt; - a sophisticated text editor for code, markup and prose;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://atom.io/&quot;&gt;Atom&lt;/a&gt; - another modern text editor;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sequelpro.com/&quot;&gt;sequelPro &lt;/a&gt; - a fast, easy-to-use Mac database management application for working with MySQL databases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have done some fun tutorials on Vim - another text editor (links available on &lt;a href=&quot;http://martapleszynska.github.io/resources.md&quot;&gt;resources&lt;/a&gt; page).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have been introduced to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; which is web-based Git repository hosting service. Git is a version control systems which helps to manage changes in documents, programs, files etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were working with the Command Line and setting up our bash profile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have learned about LAMP (Linux Apache MySQL PHP) and set it up on our machines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At last we learned how to use &lt;a href=&quot;https://jekyllrb.com/&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt; to create a site for our blog through &lt;a href=&quot;https://teamtreehouse.com/home&quot;&gt;Treehouse&lt;/a&gt; tutorials and this blog is the outcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe it sounds a lot and I have probably forgotten mention some of the things we have done but is was exciting and I am looking forward to next week.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Why do I want to learn to code?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A few years ago someone said to me: “Choose the job you love and you will never have to work a day in your life.” I really liked the idea. What job would I love? At that time I had no clue and obviously my current job wasn’t the dream job. So I began my search.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like photography so I signed up for university courses. Then I thought that it would nice if I could create my own website to showcase my photographs. This lead me to sign up for an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.open.ac.uk/&quot;&gt;Open University&lt;/a&gt; course and finally get my degree. One of the first modules I studied was “Designing applications with Visual Basic”. It made me realise that this was what I wanted to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I always liked computing and enjoyed problem solving, but I didn’t realise how much until I started discovering how a small application can be built and how its components work together. The most excitement I got was from fixing a code (which I inputted incorrectly in the first place) and getting the application working the way I wanted it to. Further I learned about creating forms using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I had no doubt that this was what I wanted to do, but I knew I had a long way to go before I became a software developer…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was fortunate enough to be accepted into &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.maydenacademy.co.uk/&quot;&gt;Mayden Academy&lt;/a&gt;. Through an intensive training programme, which is allowing me to gain valuable knowledge and work experience under the eye of professionals, I am hoping to become a software developer in just six months.&lt;/p&gt;
