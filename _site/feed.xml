        <title>Form validation - some code behind the Belbin Test website</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I thought I will share some code which have been used for validation on registration page to create Belbin 1.0.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JavaScript can be used validate forms on client side, before the request is sent to the server. By using regular expressions, we can check value inputed in text boxes against the valid characters. Here are two simple funtions in JavaScript that will validate first and last name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;javascript
function validateFirstname() {
  var firstname = document.getElementById(&#39;firstname&#39;).value;
  // firstname should be letters only
  var value = /^[a-zA-Z]+$/i;
  //test regular expression against the value in the field
  if (! value.test(firstname) )
{
  //field is cleared to encourage new correct entry
  document.getElementById(&#39;firstname&#39;).value = &quot;&quot;;
  //meassage to be used in an alert box
  result = &quot;Please enter a valid name! (Letters only).&quot;
}
else
{
  //result is an empty string if the entry is correct
  result = &quot;&quot;;
}
return result
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And similar code to validate last name:
&lt;code&gt;javascript
function validateLastname()
{
var lastname = document.getElementById(&#39;lastname&#39;).value;
// lastname should start and finish letters only
var value = /^[a-zA-Z ,.&#39;-]+$/i;
//test regular expression against the value in the field
if (! value.test(lastname) )
{
//field is cleared to encourage new correct entry
document.getElementById(&#39;lastname&#39;).value = &quot;&quot;;
result =&quot;Please enter a last name!&quot;;
}
else
{
  //result is an empty string if the entry is correct
  result = &quot;&quot;;
}
return result
}
&lt;/code&gt;
Both functions will validate input text from a text boxes and checked them against set of agreed characters. Values will be cleared if entered incorrectly and it will not allow to submit a form - which in this case, to register.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where JavaScript does not work correctly in a browser or it is switched off, validation is done using php and this is a server side validation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;php
&amp;lt;?php
function validate( $firstname, $lastname){
  $msg = &quot;&quot;;
  $value1 = &quot;/^[a-zA-Z]+$/i&quot;;
  $value2 = &quot;/^[a-zA-Z ,.&#39;-]+$/i&quot;;
  $check1 = preg_match($value1, $firstname);
  $check2 = preg_match($value2, $lastname);
  if ( $check1 == 0 ){
  $msg .= &quot;Please enter valid first name!&quot;;
  }
  if ($check2 == 0){
  $msg .= &quot;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Please enter valid last name!&quot;;
  }
  return $msg;
}
?&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
This php function has the same purpose as javascript one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Validation of forms is important. By restricting input of characters and their length you can avoid incorrect entries being submitted to the database but also it can help defend against malicious attacks like SQL injections .&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Belbin project</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;So a few days ago we have been left with an idea to create a site on which you could complete &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.belbin.com/&quot;&gt;Belbin&lt;/a&gt; personality test… Six trainees, with little or no development experience, building dynamic website that will include forms, store data and calculate results, what could be the outcome?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After three days working together coding, testing, fixing we managed to pull it off on “Belbin 1.0” was born.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Home php site with will allow you to register and and create an unique id number against which your answer will be register and stored.
&lt;img src=&quot;/img/belbinHomePage.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Belbin Test home page&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have added some validation that will disallow to leave empty spaces or usage of invalid characters like: ?%&amp;amp;! etc. After successful registration you will see an instruction page and you can click and start a test.
&lt;img /&gt;
There is one page per question. Each page has a form that consist of sentences and empty box to put value against it. There is validation on client and sever side to make sure that data entered is in correct format and saved successfully in database.
&lt;img /&gt;
After completing all section you can view your results.
&lt;img /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think we have done pretty well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was positively surprised how well we worked as team. Each of us worked on a piece of code building the website and help each other along. We had a common goal and we worked together to achieve it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I a looking forward to more project and more team work.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>First week in Mayden Academy</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The first week has flown by. It was great to meet everyone and have a glimpse of how life at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mayden.co.uk/&quot;&gt;Mayden&lt;/a&gt; looks like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from the usual admin stuff, during these five days we have managed to learn about Scrum software development methodology where a team works as an unit to reach a common goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have set up development environment by installing a bunch of programs like &lt;a href=&quot;http://brew.sh/&quot;&gt;Homebrew&lt;/a&gt; - the missing package manager that allows to install, remove and update applicationa and packages;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/&quot;&gt;phpStrom&lt;/a&gt; - smart code editor provides excellent support for PHP, HTML, JavaScript, CSS, Sass, Less, CoffeeScript, and many other languages;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sublimetext.com/&quot;&gt;Sublime Text&lt;/a&gt; - a sophisticated text editor for code, markup and prose;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://atom.io/&quot;&gt;Atom&lt;/a&gt; - another modern text editor;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sequelpro.com/&quot;&gt;sequelPro &lt;/a&gt; - a fast, easy-to-use Mac database management application for working with MySQL databases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have done some fun tutorials on Vim - another text editor (links available on &lt;a href=&quot;http://martapleszynska.github.io/resources.md&quot;&gt;resources&lt;/a&gt; page).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have been introduced to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; which is web-based Git repository hosting service. Git is a version control systems which helps to manage changes in documents, programs, files etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were working with the Command Line and setting up our bash profile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have learned about LAMP (Linux Apache MySQL PHP) and set it up on our machines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At last we learned how to use &lt;a href=&quot;https://jekyllrb.com/&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt; to create a site for our blog through &lt;a href=&quot;https://teamtreehouse.com/home&quot;&gt;Treehouse&lt;/a&gt; tutorials and this blog is the outcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe it sounds a lot and I have probably forgotten mention some of the things we have done but is was exciting and I am looking forward to next week.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Why do I want to learn to code?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A few years ago someone said to me: “Choose the job you love and you will never have to work a day in your life.” I really liked the idea. What job would I love? At that time I had no clue and obviously my current job wasn’t the dream job. So I began my search.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like photography so I signed up for university courses. Then I thought that it would nice if I could create my own website to showcase my photographs. This lead me to sign up for an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.open.ac.uk/&quot;&gt;Open University&lt;/a&gt; course and finally get my degree. One of the first modules I studied was “Designing applications with Visual Basic”. It made me realise that this was what I wanted to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I always liked computing and enjoyed problem solving, but I didn’t realise how much until I started discovering how a small application can be built and how its components work together. The most excitement I got was from fixing a code (which I inputted incorrectly in the first place) and getting the application working the way I wanted it to. Further I learned about creating forms using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I had no doubt that this was what I wanted to do, but I knew I had a long way to go before I became a software developer…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was fortunate enough to be accepted into &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.maydenacademy.co.uk/&quot;&gt;Mayden Academy&lt;/a&gt;. Through an intensive training programme, which is allowing me to gain valuable knowledge and work experience under the eye of professionals, I am hoping to become a software developer in just six months.&lt;/p&gt;
