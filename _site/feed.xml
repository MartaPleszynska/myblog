        <title>First week in Mayden Academy</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The first week flew by. It was great to meet everyone and have a glimpse of how life in Mayden looks like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from the usual admin stuff, during these five days we have managed to learn about Scrum software development methodology where a team works as an unit to reach a common goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have set up development environment by installing a bunch o softwares like Homebrew, phpStrom, NPM, SublimeText, Atom, Vim, Dash ( not sure if remembered them all).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have done some fun tutorials on Vim and watched some videos about other text editors (Atom, SublimeText, phpStorm)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have been introduced to GitHub which is web-based Git repository hosting service. Git is a version control systems which helps to manage changes in documents, programs, files etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were working with the command line amd setting up our bash profile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have learned about LAMP (Linux Apache MySQL PHP) and set it up on our machines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At least we learned how to use Jekyll to create a site for our blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;tbc&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Why do I want to learn to code?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A few years ago someone said to me: “Choose the job you love and you will never have to work a day in your life.” and I really liked the idea. What job would I love? At that time I had no clue and obviously my current job wasn’t the dream job. So I  began my search.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like photography so I signed up for university courses. Then I thought that it would nice if I could create my own website to showcase my photographs. This lead me sign up for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.open.ac.uk/&quot;&gt;Open University&lt;/a&gt; course and finally get my degree. One of the first modules I was studying was “Designing applications with Visual Basic” which made me realise that this is what I wanted to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I always liked computing and enjoyed problem solving but I was not aware how much until I started discovering how a small application can be built and how its components work together. The most excitement I got was from fixing a code (which I inputted wrong in the first place) and getting the application working the way I want it to. Further I learned about creating forms using HTML, CSS and JavaScript and I had no more doubts, but I knew I had a long way to go to become a software developer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luckily, I got into &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.maydenacademy.co.uk/&quot;&gt;Mayden Academy&lt;/a&gt;. Through intensive training programme, which is allowing me to gain valuable knowledge and work experience under the eye of professionals, I am hoping to become a software developer in just six months.&lt;/p&gt;
