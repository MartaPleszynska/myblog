      <p>The first week flew by. It was great to meet everyone and have a glimpse of how life in Mayden looks like.</p>

<p>Apart from the usual admin stuff, during these five days we have managed to learn about Scrum software development methodology where a team works as an unit to reach a common goal.</p>

<p>We have set up development environment by installing a bunch o softwares like Homebrew, phpStrom, NPM, SublimeText, Atom, Vim, Dash ( not sure if remembered them all).</p>

<p>We have done some fun tutorials on Vim and watched some videos about other text editors (Atom, SublimeText, phpStorm)</p>

<p>We have been introduced to GitHub which is web-based Git repository hosting service. Git is a version control systems which helps to manage changes in documents, programs, files etc.</p>

<p>We were working with the command line amd setting up our bash profile.</p>

<p>We have learned about LAMP (Linux Apache MySQL PHP) and set it up on our machines.</p>

<p>At least we learned how to use Jekyll to create a site for our blog.</p>
