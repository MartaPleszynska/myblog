      <p>A few years ago someone said to me: “Choose the job you love and you will never have to work a day in your life.” and I really liked the idea. What job would I love? At that time I had no clue and obviously my current job wasn’t the dream job. So I  began my search.</p>

<p>I like photography so I signed up for university courses. Then I thought that it would nice if I could create my own website to showcase my photographs. This lead me sign up for <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/">Open University</a> course and finally get my degree. One of the first modules I was studying was “Designing applications with Visual Basic” which made me realise that this is what I wanted to do.</p>

<p>I always liked computing and enjoyed problem solving but I was not aware how much until I started discovering how a small application can be built and how its components work together. The most excitement I got was from fixing a code (which I inputted wrong in the first place) and getting the application working the way I want it to. Further I learned about creating forms using HTML, CSS and JavaScript and I had no more doubts, but I knew I had a long way to go to become a software developer.</p>

<p>Luckily, I got into <a href="http://www.maydenacademy.co.uk/">Mayden Academy</a>. Through intensive training programme, which is allowing me to gain valuable knowledge and work experience under the eye of professionals, I am hoping to become a software developer in just six months.</p>
